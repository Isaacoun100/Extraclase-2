# Extraclase-2
Welcome to the Extraclase-2 readME file! this is meant to guide you through the project.
In this repository, you will find what consists of example implementation of some software design patterns, more specifically,
Adapter and Facade patterns. This are part of the required investigation for our Extraclass work in CE-1103 course for this term.
Both patterns were intended to run completely apart from each other, therefore, the developers decided to create a single package
for each of the patterns. To test the functionality of the latter, you will have to run the `main()` method included in a Main class
in the following order:
`Client.java` for the Facade pattern
`USBank.java` for the Adapter pattern


This extraclass work is part of the Algorithms and Data Structures assignments for Computer Engineering students @TEC Costa Rica.
